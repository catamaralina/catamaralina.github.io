<p>At the core, I use art as a way to convey emotions. Each work I do has an emotion or memory focused into it. As emotions are complex, so is my art.
   When I create abstract art, there is no focus, it is purely channeling emotions onto the canvas. More traditional art is very intentional, with every 
   piece having a meaning, a reason to be there. Each piece has a story and many meanins layered behind it. </p>

<!--<p>As an artist, I am always trying new things. Perhaps too many things, however I find that there is always another way to express your vision. While 
   practicing core skills in highschool, I eventually diverged off headfirst into different media. At the core I work with acrylic on canvas. I enjoy more 
   of a 'hands-on' approach, working with the paint and feeling it out onto the canvas. I have done many pieces in watercolor, yet find it too contankerous
   of a media to enjoy it. Pencil, charcoal, and pen I enjoy, though I find it more time consuming to figure out <i>what</i> I want to convey, and exactly 
   <i>how</i> I am going to express it with specifically chosen subjects. Using sewing, embroidery, and beading as a means of artistic expression has
   always fascinated me, however, the lack of skill & patience I possess with thread & needle is something to be desired, so those pieces are far and 
   few inbetween. </p>

<p>Below are a collection of pieces that I have done over the years. Some are more recent than others, but have all been done in the past few years. </p>
