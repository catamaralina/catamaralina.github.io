<p>At the core, I use art as a way to convey emotions. Each work I do has an emotion or memory focused into it. As emotions are complex, so is my art.
   When I create abstract pieces, there is no focus, it is purely channeling emotions onto the canvas. More traditional pieces are very intentional, with every 
   part of the artwork having layers of meanings, a story and reasons to be there. </p>

<!--<p>As an artist, I am always trying new things. Perhaps too many things, however I find that there is always another way to express your vision. While 
   practicing core skills in highschool, I eventually diverged off headfirst into different media. At the core I work with acrylic on canvas. I enjoy more 
   of a 'hands-on' approach, working with the paint and feeling it out onto the canvas. I have done many pieces in watercolor, yet find it too contankerous
   of a media to enjoy it. Pencil, charcoal, and pen I enjoy, though I find it more time consuming to figure out <i>what</i> I want to convey, and exactly 
   <i>how</i> I am going to express it with specifically chosen subjects. Using sewing, embroidery, and beading as a means of artistic expression has
   always fascinated me, however, the lack of skill & patience I possess with thread & needle is something to be desired, so those pieces are far and 
   few inbetween. </p>

<p>Below are a collection of pieces that I have done over the years. Some are more recent than others, but have all been done in the past few years. </p>
