<h1>Background</h1>
  <p>b. 1997</p>
  <p>Currently living in a quiet neigborhood aka. by a cemetary, she attends online classes with varying success. Wish her luck. Regularly she goes for hikes, annually dissappearing somewhere in the Appalachions for a bit more adventure. When she has time to kill, she works on trying & perfecting recipes or learning ASL and Japanese. You can usually find her reading a depressing book otherwise known as world history.</p>
  <p><i>"Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. Do justly, now. Love mercy, now. Walk humbly, now. You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it."</i></p>
